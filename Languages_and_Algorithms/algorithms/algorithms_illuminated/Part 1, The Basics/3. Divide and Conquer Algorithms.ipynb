    "### Divide and Conquer algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will code and analyse the following three divide and conquer algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Counting the number of inversions\n",
    "2. Matrix multiplication using Strassen's algorithm\n",
    "3. Computing the closest points together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting the Number of inversions\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting the number of inversions is a measure of how similar (or not similar) are two arrays of numbers. This algorithm is used in recommender systems where the system recommends something (say a movie) to the consumer based on how similar their rating is to other people who rated similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is a technique where we try to find similarities between likes of people. Suppose we want to find similarities of the movie rankings of two people, we will sort movies by ranking of one person's preference and then put ranks given by the second person for those movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if your ranked 3 movies A, B and C as your favorite movies and your friend ranked their favorite movies as B A C then between you and the your friend the ranking list becomes 2 1 3 because A is your favorite movie but is second favorite for B. Similarly B is your second favorite movie but your friend's favorite. Both you and your friend's choice match for the third best movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example we see that if two people have similar tastes, both the arrays would be identical and there would be no inversions. Higher the number of inversions more are the differences in the preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use divide and conquer algorithm like Merge sort to find the number of inversions in an array. The number of inversions in an array A are the number of pairs of indices $(i, j)$ where $i < j$ and $A[i] < A[j]$\n",
    "\n",
    "An array that is sorted has no inversions, the converse is also true, that is, an array with no inversions is sorted and is not sorted if it has atleast one inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following array\n",
    "\n",
    "1 3 5 2 4 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of inversions in this array are the following pair of numbers\n",
    "(3, 2), (5, 2) and (5, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "For an array of n numbers, we can have a maxumum of (n - 1) + (n - 2) + .. + 1 number of inversions = $n(n - 1) / 2$ number of inversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement ``counting inversion`` in two different ways. First one is the Bruteforce approach and the second one is using divide and conquer approach that sorts the numbers using Merge Sort along with counting the number of inversions.\n",

Then perform linear work outside the recursive calls.\n",

We then filter points $S_y := \\{q_1, q_2\\dots q_l\\}$ which are all points by doing a linear scan of $P_y$ and with their x coordinates between $\\bar{x} - \\delta$ and $\\bar{x} + \\delta$. Thus give is a thick strip of width $2\\delta$ around the median $\\bar{x}$. This operation takes linear time.\n",
    "3. Next, we iterate through these points in $S_y$ and look no further than 7 points (or the last point in the list $S_y$, whichever is minimum) to and compute distance between them in Brute force, on each iteration we compare te distance with the best we have and continue in the loop. The upper bound of this loop iterations is $7n \\leq 7n$ and thus this is a linear time operation and the entire ``ClosestSplitPair`` is a linear time operation.\n",

    "The following corollary this follows, if (p, q) is a split pair such that $d(p, q) < \\delta$, then in the ``ClosestSplitPair`` algorithm, the points p and q, by above Lemma, are guaranteed to be present in $S_y$ and are no do not have more than 6 points separating them. Since the routine performs am exhaustive search and satisfies both these conditions, the ``ClosestSplitPair`` thus indeed find the correct points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now prove the Lemma we stated earlier. We will prove the two claims one by one. The first one is simple of the two.\n",

    "* $p = (x_1, y_1),\\:q = (x_2, y_2)$ and $\\delta $ is the minimum of the distance between points on the left of right. The value $\\bar{x}$ is the median, or the **right most** x value of the left half.\n",
    "* Since p and q are split with p in left half and q in right half we can conclude that $x_1 \\leq \\bar{x} < x_2$\n",
    "* $\\delta > d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \\geq \\sqrt{max\\{|x_1 - x_1|, |y_1 - y_2| \\}}$, thus we can say $|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2| < \\delta$\n",
    "* Since $x_1 \\leq \\bar{x}$ and $x_2$ is no more than $\\delta$ bigger than $x_1$, we can say $x_2 \\leq \\bar{x} + \\delta$\n",
    "* Similarly, $x_2 > \\bar{x}$ and is no more than $\\delta$ bigger than $x_2$, we can say $x_1 \\geq \\bar{x} - \\delta$\n",
    "* Thus $x_1 - \\delta \\leq \\bar{x} \\leq x_2 - \\delta$, another way of thing about it as follows. Suppose two people are tied with a rope of length delta, then the maximum they can travel around $\\bar{x}$ is, $\\bar{x} - \\delta$ and $\\bar{x} + \\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the set $S_y$, there are no more than 6 points separating the true closest points, p and q**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Proof*:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this point let us draw 8 boxes, each box of size $\\delta / 2$. 4 boxes will be stacked in a grid of $2\\times 2$ on each side of the $\\bar{x}$. The points p and q are split and are present on either side of $\\bar{x}$. From above proof, we know that both these points are present in $S_y$ and their x coordinates are between $\\bar{x} - \\delta$ and $\\bar{x} + \\delta$. From above proof we know that both points p and q also satisfy the condition $|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2| < \\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we draw the boxes such that the lower edge of the lower box passes through the point whose y coordinate is minimum of the two points p and q, then the points p and q will appear in one of the 4 boxes on either side of $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many points can these 8 boxes hold? Let us assume  that a box(each of size $\\delta / 2 \\times \\delta/2$) can hold multiple points. The fartest these points can be placed is when they are kept on diagonally opposite corners of this box. By pythagoras theorem, the distance between these points is is $\\sqrt{2}\\cdot \\delta / 2 = \\delta / \\sqrt{2}\\: <\\: \\delta $. Since each box lies entirely on the left of right of $\\bar{x}$, and $\\delta$ is the minimum of the distance between a pair of points on left of right, we can say that no box, each of size $\\delta / 2 \\times \\delta /2$ can contain more than 1 point in it. Since these two points p and q also exist in one of the 8 boxes, we cannot have more than these remaining 6 points between these two points p and q\n",

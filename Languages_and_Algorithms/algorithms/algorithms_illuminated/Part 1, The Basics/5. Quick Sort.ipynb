Thus the choice of Pivot function is extremely crucial for the running time of the Quick sort algorithm. We know Merge sort runs in $O(nlog n)$ time and thats what we aim for. The benefit of quick sort over Merge sort is that it requires no extra memory apart from the constant memory required to store the variables. \n",

This will continue to happen till the entire array is sorted. This is most possible uneven split we can get in Quick sort and we will end up comparing the pivot with all remaining numbers to be sorted, this giving us a worst case time complexity of $O(n^2)$\n",

    "##### Intuition\n",
    "Let us assume that the size of the input becomes $\\alpha\\cdot n$ on each iteration where $\\alpha < 0$. To lets assume we hot the base case in k iterations. Thus $\\alpha ^ k n = 1$. Taking log on both sizes gives us\n",

    "\n",
    "With the above in mind, we know that in case of quick sort taking an exact median is guaranteed to split the array in two exact parts and the running time can be derived using Master method. However, if we are ok with an approximate median, meaning, the split after partition gives us a sub array of size maximum 75% of input array (or a minimum 25% of the input array), then we can say that we would need a maximum of $log_{4/3}n$ levels till we reach the base case. In case of quick sort, the arrays are not overlapping at each level and thus the work done at each level is no more than n. Thus intuitively we have $n\\cdot log_{4/3}n$ or $O(nlogn)$ running time\n",
